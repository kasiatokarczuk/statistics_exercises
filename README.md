# Statistics Exercises in Python

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of 12 Jupyter Notebooks designed to explore concepts in **mathematical statistics**. These notebooks were created during my second year of studies and serve as a comprehensive guide to understanding statistical theory and its practical applications in Python. Each notebook focuses on a specific topic, offering a balance between theoretical insights, computational implementations, and data visualizations.

The repository emphasizes hands-on learning, featuring tasks such as probability distribution analysis, hypothesis testing, and statistical modeling. It incorporates both manual calculations and Python libraries to build a solid foundation for tackling real-world data challenges.

This collection of exercises was developed as part of a group project. The work was carried out by a team of four members, including myself and three collaborators. Working together allowed us to exchange ideas, provide mutual support in solving challenges, and improve our programming and statistical skills.

## Key Topics Covered
### 1. **Probability Distributions**
- Analysis of **discrete** and **continuous** random variables.
- Visualizations of Probability Mass Function (PMF), Probability Density Function (PDF), and Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF).
- Worked examples with binomial, Poisson, uniform, normal, and gamma distributions.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Descriptive statistics: mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.
- Advanced visualizations: boxplots, violin plots, strip plots, and swarm plots for parameter distributions.
- Heatmaps and pairplots to analyze linear correlations between parameters.

### 3. **Statistical Hypothesis Testing**
- Parametric tests: t-tests, F-tests, and chi-square tests for variance and proportions.
- Non-parametric tests: Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and chi-square goodness-of-fit.
- Visualizations of test results, including critical regions and p-values.

### 4. **Confidence Interval Estimation**
- Point and interval estimation for population mean, variance, and correlation coefficients.
- Parametric and non-parametric bootstrap methods for robust interval estimation.
- Confidence intervals for linear regression coefficients.

### 5. **Sampling Techniques**
- Implementation of random, stratified, and cluster sampling strategies.
- Strengths and weaknesses of different sampling methods.
- Analysis of representativeness in samples using theoretical and empirical distributions.

### 6. **Variance Analysis and Post-Hoc Testing**
- Analysis of variance (ANOVA) for comparing group means.
- Post-hoc tests like Tukeyâ€™s HSD for detailed comparisons.
- Visualization of variance structures and inter-group relationships.

### 7. **Bootstrap Methods**
- Estimation of sample parameters (mean, variance, correlation) using bootstrap resampling.
- Confidence intervals for regression coefficients derived via bootstrapping.
- Comparison with standard parametric approaches.

### 8. **Real-World Data Applications**
- Hands-on analysis of real datasets.
- Custom functions for tailored statistical analysis.
- Integration of Python libraries such as `scipy`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
